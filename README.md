# Research

### My workspace for general researching.

1. GNN_optim_research/ contains the study that attempted to augment the performance of simple classification tasks using GNN.

2. NIMS_workshop/ contains the work of applying GNN on the analysis of BAPL score medical data acquired from Alzheimer patients.

3. RC_TDA/ contains the study using TDA with reservoir computing(RC), to predict the bifurcation of unknown time-series. routines.py is the main module of this project, and RC_TDA/workspace/ contains codes for various experiments based on the module.

4. RPS/ contains the study of extracting time-series features from the Monte-Carlo simulation data of RPS(Rock-Paper-Scissors) biodiversity model. RPS/RPS_routines.py is the main module of this project, and RPS/workspace/ contains codes various experiments based on the module. RPS/example.ipynb shows the tutorial for using the module RPS/RPS_routines.py.
